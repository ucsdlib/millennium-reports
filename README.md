Millennium Reports
===

These shoud have ansible playbooks associated with them. They do not.

These scripts generate the IPA, IPSS and ISS reports. Instalation location should be able to be dertermined by the crontab entries. The sample configuration files should have real data supplied. Some of these scripts have their distribution lists hardcoded into the scripts themselves.

These scripts make heavy use of perl-Expect.
